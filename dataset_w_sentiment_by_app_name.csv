12140,Max Payne,"The desciption of this game is as follows: Max Payne is a man with nothing to lose in the violent, cold urban night. A fugitive undercover cop framed for murder and now hunted by cops and the mob. Max is a man with his back against the wall, fighting a battle he cannot hope to win. Prepare for a new breed of deep action game. Prepare for pain...  At a glance that discription seems like a revenge story that we've all seen before and for the most part it is, however where this game really stands out is in its delivery, tone and of course gameplay. While the game may be over a decade old I can say as someone who played Max Payne in 2014 and 2001 that it has aged very well and is worth a look for newcomers and people who are interested in replaying the game.   Pros:  Fantastic and immersive story Great variation in level design Fantastic Noir theme Great gameplay  Cons: Graphics and gameplay may be a bit too dated for some Sound issues for windows 7 and 8 users (a quick fix for this can be found in the forums) The game can be a bit unforgiving even on more easy difficulties",1,0,0.108,0.752,0.141,0.7709

244890,VelocityÂ®Ultra,"This game reminds me a lot of the old Nintendo game Abadox, except with its own unique twist with teleporting and rescuing. I'm glad I gave this game a go as it definitally has been very fun to play so far.  I give it a 9/10.",1,0,0.0,0.804,0.196,0.8503

365450,Hacknet,"A few flaws here and there but overall a pretty solid hack sim. Definitely one of the better 'light' types, and throws challenges at you in interesting ways.",1,0,0.0,0.518,0.482,0.9559
396590,CMYW,"As a big fan of Atari's Asteroids I can say this game is a nice fresh look to the idea. I like the idea of playing local multiplayer with friends. That being said I wish the controls were a little tighter, the over rotation is really frustrating, especially because the game gets hard enough on its own fairly quick. I had originally started playing with my Xbox controller, but after a bit I had to switch to my keyboard, as it felt tighter than the controller. Maybe this will be remedied in the future. As for 4 player fun though you cant beat the price.  ",1,0,0.031,0.797,0.172,0.8957
